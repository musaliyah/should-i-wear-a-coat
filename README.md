  ## Description: 
  "Should I Wear a Coat" is a weather dashboard, that allows users to search cities and display weekly weather reports. This project utilized my class knowledge of web APIs, JQuery, and local storage. This project was challenging for me as I struggled to grasp how to display local storage. However, I learned how to utilize a web API (Open Weather) to pull information from a third-party source.

  ## Installation: 
  To install my project, users must clone my repository, and open the site using the live server feature on VS Code.

  ## Usage: 
  Once on the site, users can simply search for a city in the search bar and have information regarding that cities weather display.
